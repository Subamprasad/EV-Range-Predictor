# Electric Vehicle Range Prediction

This project aims to predict the electric range of vehicles using the Washington State Electric Vehicle Population Data.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from [Washington State Department of Licensing](https://data.wa.gov/api/views/f6w7-q2d2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD).
It contains information about Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for pipelines (to be implemented).

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the notebook in `notebooks/ev_range_prediction.ipynb`.
